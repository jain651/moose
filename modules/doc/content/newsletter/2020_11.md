# MOOSE Newsletter (November 2020)

## Application Development Tutorial

The [new tutorial](getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/tutorial01_app_development/index.md) has arrived! And with it comes a restructured [getting_started/index.md] section of our website and a consolidated [getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/index.md] page that serves as a one-stop shop for all of our available learning content. The Application Development Tutorial is based on our classic "Coupled Darcy Pressure and Thermomechanics Tutorial," used for demonstrations in the [Live Workshop](getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/index.md#workshop). All of this is intended to serve as a comprehensive introduction to the MOOSE Framework.

We have released this new content only partially finished, but we hope to complete it in the coming months. We are continuing to work hard to improve the experience of new users, and veteran ones, by ensuring that they have easy access to the resources they need to solve their multiphysics problems with MOOSE.

## Reporter System

A generalization of the Postprocessor and VectorPostprocessor system was created. This new Reporter
system allows for arbitrary types to be computed and output (via JSON). For more information please
review see the [Reporters/index.md].

## MeshModifiers Removed

The MeshModifier objects were finally removed after over a year of being deprecated. The
`[MeshGenerators]` input block was also removed. All generator objects should be placed in the
`[Mesh]` block.

!alert note title=`MooseMesh` based object should +not+ be developed
In the future the `MooseMesh` based objects will also be removed, but we do not have a
time frame for that at the moment. If you need to perform custom mesh operations, please create a
`MeshGenerator` object.

## SQA Status Reports

We improved out ability to monitor documentation shortcomings for our software quality program by
creating a status report tool. This will aid in continue to improve the documentation for MOOSE
and MOOSE-based applications. The status reports for MOOSE are provided on [sqa/index.md].

## Updated Testing Machines

We are in the process of updating our testing hardware. In the coming months expect to see increased
speed from our automated testing.
