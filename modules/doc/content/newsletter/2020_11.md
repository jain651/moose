## Application Development Tutorial

The [new tutorial](getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/tutorial01_app_development/index.md) has arrived! And with it comes a restructured [getting_started/index.md] section of our website and a consolidated [getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/index.md] page that serves as a one-stop shop for all of our available learning content. The Application Development Tutorial is based on our classic "Coupled Darcy Pressure and Thermomechanics Tutorial," used for demonstrations in the [Live Workshop](getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/index.md#workshop). All of this is intended to serve as a comprehensive introduction to the MOOSE Framework.

We have released this new content only partially finished, but we hope to complete it in the coming months. We are continuing to work hard to improve the experience of new users, and veteran ones, by ensuring that they have easy access to the resources they need to solve their multiphysics problems with MOOSE.
