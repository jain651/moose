## Subdomain-specific Quadrature Order

We've recently added support allowing users to specify different quadrature orders for each subdomain/block in the mesh.
This can be done via the `Executioner/Quadrature` subblock in an input file:

```
[Executioner]
  ...
  [Quadrature]
    custom_blocks = '1 2 5'
    custom_orders = '1 7 1'
  []
[]
```

The specified quadrature orders also are applied to any face-quadrature rules executed on the subdomains.
When running face quadrature rules on a face bordering two subdomains with different quadrature orders,
the higher order is used consistently for the face.

It is also possible to bump the quadrature order on a per-subdomain basis via code in MOOSE object constructors:

```c++
YourFancyMooseObject_MaybeAMaterial_or_MaybeUserObject_etc::YourFancyMooseObject_MaybeAMaterial_or_MaybeUserObject_etc(InputParameters & params)
{
  //...
  if (some_fancy_condition)
    _fe_problem.bumpAllQRuleOrder(new_custom_order, desired_block);
  //...
```
