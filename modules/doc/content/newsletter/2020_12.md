## Migration to Github Discussions

The MOOSE development team decided to move all new questions to a [Github discussion
forum](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/discussions).

## Reporter Transfer

The ability to transfer [Reporter values](Reporters/index.md) to and from sub-applications
was added via the [MultiAppReporterTransfer.md].

## MultiApp UserObject Transfer

`MultiAppUserObjectTransfer` can now be restricted to a block or a boundary using `block` or
`boundary` parameter.  This helps to combine multiple transfers into a single variable which
can also simplify the overall simulation setup of kernels, BCs, etc.

## Scaling Support for Global AD Indexing

We have added both automatic and manual scaling support for MOOSE's global AD indexing
configuration (obtained by running `./configure --with-ad-indexing-type=global`). This works for
both finite elements and finite volumes variables.
