This page includes various demonstrations of MOOSE usage and hands-on instructions intended to introduce the basics of [!ac](MOOSE) for creating custom applications to solve unique and challenging multiphysics problems. Each example or tutorial focuses on different aspects of MOOSE, primarily the fundamental C++ classes that are available to solve multiphysics problems.

Before proceeding, please visit the [installation/index.md] page and the [getting_started/new_users.md] page. Also, for the larger part of the context in the materials provided on this page, it is assumed that the viewer has some background in computer programming, specifically with [C++](#programming).

The [!ac](MOOSE) development team at [!ac](INL) will occasionally host live workshops at [!ac](INL) and around the world. Registration is open for all who wish to attend, although space is typically limited. Below are links to the workshop slides as well as video recordings of the live workshops.

- [Workshop Slideshow](https://www.mooseframework.org/workshop)
- [MOOSE Workshop (Summer 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJwBsYaLaI)

MOOSE training events will typically be announced on the [home page](/), but be sure to join one of the [mailing lists](new_users.md#join) for further updates!

## C++ Programming References id=programming

MOOSE developers need only a basic understanding of computer programming with C and/or C++ to get started. If possible, it may be helpful to review the following resources:

- [help/c++/index.md]
- [cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
- [en.cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/)
