# Comparison of surrogates using a time-dependent problem

This example is meant to demonstrate how non-intrusive surrogate models can be
generated for time-dependent problems. Nearest Point, Polynomial Regression and
Polynomial Chaos Expansion Surrogates are compared on a non-linear diffusion
problem with an oscillating source.
